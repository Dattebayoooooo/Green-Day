    <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green; font-size: larger; ">Green Day</span> is an American punk rock band that started in the late '80s,<br>
    made up of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals/guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass), and Tr√© Cool (drums).<br>
    They're known for blending punk energy with catchy melodies and rebellious lyrics.<br>
    <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green; font-size: larger;">Green Day</span> broke into the mainstream with their 1994 album <em>Dookie</em>, a massive hit.<br>
    Songs like "Basket Case" and "When I Come Around" became youth anthems.<br>
    In 2004, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green; font-size: larger;">Green Day</span> released <em>American Idiot</em>, a politically charged punk rock opera.<br>
    That album was a turning point and later adapted into a Broadway musical.<br>
    <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green; font-size: larger;">Green Day</span> evolved their sound but kept their attitude and message strong.<br>
    They've won Grammy Awards, sold millions of albums, and stayed relevant for decades.<br>
    In 2015, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green; font-size: larger;">Green Day</span> was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br>
